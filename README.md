# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

The Sorting Algorithm Visualizer project is a Python and Pygame-based application that generates 200 random elements and visually demonstrates the sorting process using insertion sort, selection sort, or bubble sort.

## Project Overview

Sorting Algorithm Visualizer aims to provide a visual representation of the sorting process using various algorithms. By offering a dynamic and interactive way to observe the behavior of sorting algorithms, this project enhances understanding and learning for both beginners and experienced developers.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need Python and Pygame installed on your machine. If you haven't installed Pygame yet, you can do so using the following command:

```
pip install pygame
```

### Running the Visualizer

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

3. Run the visualizer program:

```
python main.py
```

## Features and Usage

The Sorting Algorithm Visualizer allows users to:
- Choose between insertion sort, selection sort, or bubble sort.
- Visualize the step-by-step sorting process in real-time.
- Observe how different algorithms operate and compare their efficiency.

## Technologies Used

This project is developed using:
- Python: Core programming language.
- Pygame: Library for creating interactive games and simulations.

## How It's Made

The visualizer generates a set of random elements and applies the chosen sorting algorithm. Each step of the sorting process is displayed using Pygame graphics, allowing users to see the algorithm's behavior in action.

## Future Enhancements

- Add more sorting algorithms to the visualizer.
- Include options for customizing array size and speed of visualization.
- Implement real-time analysis of algorithm complexity.
